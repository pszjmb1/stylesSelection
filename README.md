stylesSelection
===============

Automatically change Meteor's css file from a selection.

Adding this package to your [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com/) application adds `jmbStyles` template to the client. This version comes with Thomas Park's Bootswatch open source Bootstrap themes. If you want to use different css files or themes then add your files to the folder packages/stylesSelection/lib/public/css (note the file suffix should be "min.css"), and update the file packages/stylesSelection/jmbStyles.html.

Installation
------------

```
mrt add stylesSelection
```
